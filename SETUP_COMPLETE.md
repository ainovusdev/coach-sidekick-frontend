# ✅ Vector Search Setup Complete

## System Status

All components are successfully installed and running:

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Weaviate** | ✅ Running | v1.24.1 on port 8080 |
| **Weaviate Client** | ✅ Installed | v3.26.7 (compatible) |
| **Backend API** | ✅ Running | Port 8000 with chat endpoints |
| **Frontend** | ✅ Running | Port 3000 |
| **Chat Endpoints** | ✅ Registered | `/api/v1/chat/clients/{id}/chat` |

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

### 2. Index Session Transcripts
1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to any client profile
3. Go to the "Sessions" tab
4. Find a session with transcripts
5. Click the **"Analyze"** button
6. Wait for analysis to complete (check backend logs for "Indexed X chunks")

### 3. Use the Chat Feature
1. After analysis is complete, go to the **"Ask AI"** tab
2. You'll see knowledge base statistics:
   - Number of indexed sessions
   - Total knowledge chunks
   - Top topics discussed
3. Ask questions about the client, such as:
   - "What are this client's main goals?"
   - "What challenges have they mentioned?"
   - "How has their confidence changed over time?"
   - "What patterns do you see in our conversations?"

### 4. View Source Attribution
- Each answer shows which sessions the information came from
- Confidence levels indicate how certain the AI is about the answer
- Click on sources to see more details

## What's Working

### Semantic Chunking
- Transcripts are intelligently divided into ~1500 character chunks
- Chunks overlap by 200 characters for context continuity
- Topics, speaker ratios, and chunk types are automatically extracted

### Vector Search
- Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
- Hybrid search combines semantic and keyword matching
- Filtered by client for data isolation

### Chat Interface
- Natural language Q&A about clients
- Source attribution with confidence scores
- Suggested questions based on available data
- Clean, monochromatic UI design

## Troubleshooting

### If Chat Shows "No Knowledge Base Yet"
1. Make sure you've analyzed at least one session
2. Check backend logs for any indexing errors
3. Verify Weaviate is running: `curl http://localhost:8080/v1/.well-known/ready`

### To Restart Services
```bash
# Restart Weaviate
cd ~/Documents/coach-sidekick/coach-sidekick-backend
docker-compose restart weaviate

# Restart Backend
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Restart Frontend
cd ~/Documents/coach-sidekick/coach-sidekick-ui
pnpm dev
```

### To Check Logs
```bash
# Backend logs
# Look for: "Indexed X chunks for session Y"

# Weaviate logs
docker-compose logs -f weaviate
```

## Next Steps

1. **Index More Sessions**: The more sessions you analyze, the better the AI can answer questions
2. **Test Different Questions**: Try various question types to explore the system's capabilities
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check response times and accuracy as data grows

## Technical Details

- **Weaviate Version**: 1.24.1 (stable, REST API)
- **Client Library**: weaviate-client v3.26.7
- **Embedding Model**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
- **Chunk Size**: ~1500 characters with 200 char overlap
- **Search Type**: Hybrid (75% semantic, 25% keyword)

The vector search system is now fully operational and ready for use!
